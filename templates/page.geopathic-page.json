            "content_1": "<p>This was proved to the German medical profession over 80 years ago and in million of cases ever since. It was first recognised in thousands of cases of cancer and later it was found that it has to be dealt with before any therapy could work 100% and ensure your body could repair itself.</p>",
            "image_conetnt_block_content_1": "<h2></h2><h2>[* <strong>Geopathic Stress is found in the majority of cases of:</strong>*]</h2><h2></h2><ul><li><strong>Cancer, M.E., P.M.S., Bipolar Disorder, Autism, M.S., Alzheimer’s, Epilepsy, Suicide, Cot Death </strong></li><li></li><li><strong>Stillborn Babies and post Traumatic Stress Disorders.</strong></li><li></li><li><strong>Long-term physical and mental illnesses, where current treatment does not seem to work.</strong></li><li><strong>Babies who cry continuously during the night.</strong></li><li><strong>Children who are hyperactive – have learning difficulties – are difficult to control.</strong></li><li><strong>Children born with defects.</strong></li><li><strong>Miscarriage, premature birth, not being able to conceive and difficult pregnancies.</strong></li><li><strong>Child Abuse.</strong></li><li><strong>Road Rage.</strong></li><li></li></ul><p>The most common indications of GS are:- Resistance to medical treatment, a feeling of being run-down and exhausted, nervousness, depression, loss of appetite, pallor and not wanting to go to bed and when in bed: insomnia, restless sleep, feeling cold, cramps, tingling in arms and legs, sleep walking, grinding of teeth and nightmares. When waking in the morning often feeling fatigued, with a muzzy head and backache. Children are often bed wetting and babies continuously crying.</p><ul><li>GS does not cause an illness, but lowers your immune system, so you have less chance of fighting any illness. GS also prevents your body properly absorbing vitamins, minerals, trace elements etc. from your food (and supplements) and often making you allergic to food, drinks and environmental pollution.</li></ul>",
            "content_2": "<h2></h2><h2>[* <strong>What is Geopathic Stress?</strong>*]</h2><p>Geopathic Stress is the Earths vibrations which rise up through the Earth and are distorted by weak electromagnetic fields created by subterranean running water, certain mineral concentrations, fault lines and underground cavities. The vibration distorted becomes abnormally high and harmful to living organisms.</p><p>Geopathic Stress has become many times stronger over the years. We believe this is due to ‘solar weather’ caused by the sun penetrating the weaker ozone layer more easily. No doubt the stronger GS is one of the main reasons for the steady increase in serious illness (cancer cases have doubled over the last 20 years).</p>",
            "image_conetnt_block_content_2": "<h2></h2><h2>[* <strong>Detecting Geopathic Stress</strong>*]</h2><p>Most people can check themselves if there is Geopathic Stress in their home* but there is no scientific instrument yet which is sensitive and selective enough. However, there are now many recognised methods of detecting GS in people, like the VEGA Test, Blood Crystalline Analysis, electro-acupuncture, kinesiology etc. which can also confirm if the GS has been cleared.</p><p></p><h2>[* <strong>How do I know if I’m Geopathic stressed?</strong>*]</h2><h2></h2><p>If you cannot shake off an illness, depression or feel below par, ask yourself:</p><ol><li>Did my health problem begin shortly after moving into this home or place of work?</li><li>Do I feel better when I am away from the home or place of work?</li><li>Do any of my family feel uneasy about the ‘atmosphere’ at home?</li><li>Did the previous occupant’s suffer from any serious or long term illness?</li><li>Does the illness seem to be worse during autumn or spring or wet stormy weather? (when underground water may be flowing at higher velocity)</li><li>Were there any nearby disturbances, which may have caused underground water veins to flow into different channels under my house prior to my illness? (landslides, building and road work, working quarries and working mines etc)</li><li>Does my home or any part of it feel unnaturally cold or damp?</li></ol>",
            "content_3": "<p></p><p><strong>[*Geopathic Stress and Sleep*]<br/></strong>Sleeping in a GS place is particularly stressful, as a large area of your body is exposed to the GS. Also most people sleep during the night, when the GS is stronger. During sleep your brain is supposed to rest half the time and is busy healing your body the other half. However, if you are GS during sleep your brain has to spend all of it’s time working due to the strain of GS and you wake up tired.</p><p>The 1 sq. metre (10 sq. ft.) you sleep on and therefore spend about one third of your life on, must be free from Geopathic Stress.</p><p>During sleep your brain does your body’s ‘housekeeping’ including creating 80% of your new cells, giving the right signals for your body to operate properly and absorb the correct level of vitamins and minerals together with adjusting hormone balance. GS will interfere with this process and leave your immune system weak. All these body functions will usually become normal very quickly after GS has cleared from your system, by sleeping in a GS-free place.</p><p></p><p><strong>[*M.E. Sufferers*]<br/></strong>In a report published by the Royal Society of Medicine it was suggested most cases of chronic fatigue ‘would get well through sleep’. BUT people who are suffering from M.E. are most likely to be sleeping in a strong Geopathic Stressed place, thereby creating a vicious circle. You feel tired so you go to the worst place – your bed.</p><p></p><p><strong>[*Psychological Conditions*]<br/></strong>GS is present in the majority of people who are depressed, suicidal and the many of people who get divorced (one or both spouses).</p><p></p><p><strong>[*Answers to Sceptics*]<br/></strong>Many feel the effect of GS is purely psychological and due to suggestion, but then you cannot influence the behavior of animals, plants and babies.</p><p>Most animals will prefer to sleep in a good place and will become ill if forced to live in a GS home, stables etc.</p><p>Most types of trees will have stunted growth and not bear fruit in GS places. You will often find plants will not thrive in a GS place in a house.</p><p>Below are cases where babies have been trying to avoid GS in their sleep. All the babies slept peacefully after their cots were moved to a Geopathic Stress free place.</p>",
            "image_conetnt_block_content_3": "<p></p><p><strong>[*Moving House<br/></strong>We have heard it hundreds of times, [*<em><strong>“We have felt uncomfortable ever since we moved into this house/flat, our health has deteriorated and our previously happy family have become miserable”.</strong></em> So even though you have never heard of Geopathic Stress, you may have felt the effects of it. The outcome has often been that you have moved home again at great expense. That is why houses and flats badly affected by Geopathic Stress come on the market more often than homes, which have none or very little Geopathic Stress.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why you felt uneasy when you walked into a particular room or why most people in certain houses are all ill? Most likely it is due to Geopathic Stress.</p><p></p><p><strong>[*Long Life<br/></strong>It is estimated your chances of living beyond mid-seventy is 90% unless you are Geopathic Stressed (not taking into account accidents, smoking, heavy users of drugs, bad diet and lack of Q10).</p><p>Remember Geopathic Stress does not cause any illness, but lowers your immune system and your ability to fight off viruses and bacterium.</p><p><strong>[*Feng Shui<br/></strong>Most people who deal with Feng Shui realise GS is the first thing to check for to ensure a ‘happy home’.</p><p></p><p><strong>[*Your Health is like a bucket<br/></strong>A bucket which gradually gets filled up with things harmful to your life. Geopathic Stress could fill up 50%. It then gets filled up by bad diet, unhealthy food additives, physical and mental strain from accidents, psychological trauma, smoking, excess drinking, strained relationships with other people, effects from illness, or death in the family, work, financial pressure, effects from electromagnetic fields and other environmental pollution etc.</p><p>Suddenly your bucket overflows and you get a serious illness.</p><p>Take the Geopathic Stress away, and your bucket may only be 50% full and your immune system will strengthen, enabling you to cope with e.g. E.Coli, power lines and all the other things listed above.</p><p>Many people seem to think we are getting more and more affected by Geopathic Stress. This is true, but mainly because we are filling up the bucket quicker by adding Pollution, etc.</p>"
