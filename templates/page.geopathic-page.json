            "content_1": "<p>This was proved to the German medical profession over 80 years ago and in million of cases ever since. It was first recognised in thousands of cases of cancer and later it was found that it has to be dealt with before any therapy could work 100% and ensure your body could repair itself.</p>",

When waking in the morning often feeling fatigued, with a muzzy head and backache. Children are often bed wetting and babies continuously crying.</p><ul><li>GS does not cause an illness, but lowers your immune system, so you have less chance of fighting any illness. GS also prevents your body properly absorbing vitamins, minerals, trace elements etc. from your food (and supplements) and often making you allergic to food, drinks and environmental pollution.</li></ul>",
            "content_2": "<h2></h2><h2>[* <strong>What is Geopathic Stress?</strong>*]</h2><p>Geopathic Stress is the Earths vibrations which rise up through the Earth and are distorted by weak electromagnetic fields created by subterranean running water, certain mineral concentrations, fault lines and underground cavities. The vibration distorted becomes abnormally high and harmful to living organisms.</p><p>Geopathic Stress has become many times stronger over the years. We believe this is due to ‘solar weather’ caused by the sun penetrating the weaker ozone layer more easily. No doubt the stronger GS is one of the main reasons for the steady increase in serious illness (cancer cases have doubled over the last 20 years).</p>",
