You need to kill the bacteria without blocking the glands, otherwise the toxins go back into your lymph nodes, many of which are near the upper outer part of your breasts, where the larger number of breast cancers tumours develop.</p><p></p><p>Most traditional antiseptic deodorant stick or spray will block your sweat glands and may contain Propyl Alcohol which can encourage parasites present in most cases of cancer. An even quicker why for Propyl Alcohol to enter your blood stream under your armpit, is when shaving because you can accidentally cut the skin and expose blood vessels.</p>",
