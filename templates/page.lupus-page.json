She had a heavy rash on her face, could not walk and lost most of her hair. Now, she often walks 4 miles. She no longer has a rash nor joint pains and her hair has grown back. Liz’s liver and kidneys are now working normally again.</p><p></p><p>Mary, in her forties, was diagnosed with Lupus 2½ years ago, which made her feel very fatigued, had a ‘butterfly’ rash across the bridge of her nose, joint pains all over and felt no better after long orthodox treatment. Mary no longer has problems with Lupus and is now an active teacher again.</p><p></p><p>On her second check-up, over a three month period, Mary’s blood again showed no Lupus and the Professor, who specialises in Lupus, discharged Mary and said that she now looked healthier than most doctors at the hospital. When Mary told the Professor about our help, the Professor’s reply was ‘No’, Mary had ‘grown out of Lupus’.
