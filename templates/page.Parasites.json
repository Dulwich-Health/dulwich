            "content_1": "<h2><strong>[*Parasites*]</strong></h2><h4>Many doctors, health practitioners and researchers now believe parasites are the most under diagnosed and under appreciated health threat in the world.</h4><h4></h4><h4>A parasite is an organism, which lives off its host like humans. They live a parallel life inside our bodies feeding off our energy, our own cells or the food we eat, even feeding off the food supplements we take.</h4><h4></h4><p>Dr Hulda Regeht Clark claims in her world famous book <em><strong>‘The Cure For All Diseases’</strong></em>,  that all long-term illnesses are caused by parasites, including diabetics, seizures, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraines, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Multiple Sclerosis, AIDS and cancer. Also in cases of multiple allergies (especially food allergies) chronic bowel symptoms, eating more but still feeling hungry, tinnitus, pain and inflammation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Normally, our immune system and liver can kill off any parasites we may get, but as soon as the immune system has been weakened by stress, pollution, viruses, bacteria and Geopathic Stress – the parasites establish themselves and become immensely harmful. Parasites are more likely to affect the elderly and chronically ill.</p><p></p><h3><strong>[*Geopathic Stress</strong></h3><p>In nearly all cases where parasites have caused cancer and other illnesses, the parasites will attack the area, where the Geopathic Stress is particularly strong, such as where two or three Geopathic Stress Lines cross your bed. For example, if they cross where your brain, breast, stomach etc. is and in cases of leukaemia and skin cancer, where a strong Geopathic Stress Line covers the whole body. Your body mainly repairs your immune system, when you sleep, but this is not 100% possible if you have to fight the Geopathic Stress.</p><p></p><p>You may very well ask <em>“How can parasites possible live in my body if I don’t know it is there?”</em> – The mission of a parasite is not to make ‘itself’ known. A small parasite lives without being detected, because it knows once detected, it will be eradicated. Parasites are highly intelligent organisms, not in a human sense, but in their ability to survive and reproduce, which is the purpose of any organism (see more about parasites under notes).</p><p></p><p>Dr Clark suggested detecting parasites harmful to you by using a Syncometer™. This sounds very complicated. I think you will find using the Muscle Test is easier and costs you nothing. However, if you accept that it is normal to have lower energy levels, health challenges, skin rashes, pains, frequent colds, flu and constipation (the list is endless for the things parasites will cause), then you have never questioned whether you have parasites.</p><p></p><p>If a Doctor tests you for parasites, chances are the results will come back negative. Does this mean you do not have parasites? Unfortunately, medical testing is only available for about 40 to 50 of the over 1000 species of parasites, that can live in your body. Getting rid of all these parasites would be impossible using clinical medicines that can only kill a few types of parasites at a time. Such medicines tend to make you quite ill and can cause extreme nausea, vomiting, severe rashes all over the body and some are very toxic. Imagine taking 10 such drugs to kill a dozen of your parasites!</p><p></p><p>Dr Hulda Clark claims there are three main herbs, which can kill over 100 types of parasites, without neither side effects nor interfering with any drugs you are already taking. She says this is nature’s gift to us!</p><p></p><p>The herbs are Black Walnut hull (from the Black Walnut tree). Wormwood (from the Artemesial shrub), and common Clove (from the Clove tree). These three herbs must be used together, to rid you or parasites. Black Walnut hull and Wormwood kill adult parasites. Cloves kill the eggs.</p><p></p><p>Clark goes into great detail in her book on how to prepare these herbs, but for most people, I believe, it would be difficult to get the herbs fresh and be able to prepare them. If you do want to get the herbs contact your local qualified herbalist. However, it has now been discovered that Olive Leaf Extract (Eden Extract) and Oil of Wild Oregano (see separate details) are in their own right among the most powerful natural herrbal remedies available for a broad spectrum of illnesses, using them together is an extremely powerful weapon in their capacity to eradicate severe and persistent parasitic, fungal and yeast infections.</p><p></p><p>Oil of Wild Oregano contains the phenol – carvacrol – a potent antiseptic which eradicates fungi and parasites. Eden Extract is the only olive leaf extract to deliver d-elenolic acid into the blood system. It is a powerful broad-spectrum killer of pathogens. Including yeast fungi, bacteria, parasites and viruses. Used together these two 100% natural remedies deliver a knock out punch!!</p>",
            "image_conetnt_block_content_1": "<p></p><p>The suggested dose to rid yourself of parasites is: 1x Eden Capsules plus 2x Oreganol Capsules 2 times a day with plenty of water and between meals. The dose must be doubled 7 days before the Full Moon, when the parasites have been know to lay their eggs. Carry on the treatment for about a month. Then go down to a maintenance dose of 2 capsule of each between meals for another 2 month. For Multiple Sclerosis you need higher doses to start with, say 6 to 8 capsules each per day.</p><p></p><p>Parasites are everywhere around you and you can pick them up outdoors through your hands and bare feet. You can get them from other people, your family and your home, your pets and undercooked meat. After we are infected with it this way, we can give it to each other through blood, saliva, semen, breast milk, kissing on the mouth, sex, nursing and child bearing. Family members often have the same parasites. They should give themselves the same parasite-killing program at a lower-level, including their dogs and cats. Remember to test with the muscle test to see if you have parasites.</p><p></p><h3><strong>[*Dispensing of Dead Parasites</strong></h3><p>It is most important to clear your body, not only of the dead parasites, its eggs etc. but also of the waste products and toxins they have produced. You should detoxify yourself, before and during ridding yourself of parasites. A very successful product to take is OxyTech; you should take enough to have two to three bowel movements a day.</p><p></p><p>It is also very important you ‘restock’ your colon with friendly bacteria, the parasites have consumed or killed. 70% of our immune system is in our gut and is called GALT (gut associated lymphoid tissue). In your small intestines and colon, there should be about 2 kilograms (that’s 1,200 trillion) friendly germs. Unfortunately, they are being reduced by medicines and pathogens. Bio-Culture is an excellent product by Pharma Nord UK to revitalise your digestive system. Each capsule of Bio-Culture contains between 1 and 10 billion friendly bacteria. Drink plenty of water during your ‘de-parasiting program’. Using Detox Foot Pads will also help to detoxify you or several treatments in a detox foot spa.</p><p></p><h3><strong>[*Zapping Parasites</strong></h3><p>Although the herbal parasite-killing program is highly effective against parasites, Clark claims you should also kill them electronically. Each method has its own area of great effectiveness. Clark describes how you can build your own Zapper in her book. You can also buy them ready-made. The principle behind Clark’s Zapper1 is resonance. Theoretically by exposing a micro-organism to its resonant frequency you will make it burst. What is resonance?</p>",
